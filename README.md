# flames-using-Python-GUI 
## Give a chance to python to guess your fate !!

This is a small project using python GUI. I have used [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) package to develop this project.
This framework provides Python users with a simple way to create GUI elements using the widgets found in the Tk toolkit.
To run this 

1. Clone the repo
2. Make sure you have installed the Tkinter package
3. To install Tkinter package "pip install tkinter"

Have fun !! ðŸ˜‰
